## Notes for Implementation

1. **Agile Approach**: While this roadmap is presented in sequential phases, consider implementing an agile approach with 1-2 week sprints that may include tasks from multiple phases.

2. **Independent Testing**: Each component and feature should be independently testable before integration into the main codebase.

3. **Continuous Feedback**: Incorporate user feedback throughout the development process, not just during dedicated testing phases.

4. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation for all components, APIs, and configurations.

5. **Accessibility**: Consider accessibility from the beginning of development, not as an afterthought.

6. **Performance Budget**: Establish performance budgets for each page and component to ensure the site remains fast and responsive.

7. **Phase Completion Criteria**: Before considering a phase complete, ensure all testing criteria are met and documented.
